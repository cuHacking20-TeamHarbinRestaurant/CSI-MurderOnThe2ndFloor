* Crime Scene Investigator

Restore crime scene with high fidelity in time and space dimensions to help analyze suspects!

## Inspiration
Martello forensic data analytic challenge
https://martellotech.com/cuhacking/

## What it does
We created a tool that helps the forensic team to simulate crime scenes and analyze the suspects by their behaviour based on time and space.

## How I built it
We took advantage of the modern web technology like `d3.js`, `WebGL`, `Plotly.js`, `Node.js` to build an analyzer restoring the crime scene with high fidelity.

## Challenges I ran into
None of us has experienced in the visualization library.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We made it!

## What I learned
- Learned how to discuss an unfamiliar problem with teammates from different programming backgrounds.
- Learned how to modify data visualization library to meet our purpose

## What's next for Crime Scene Investigator
We could give more advice on reducing the suspects by correlating their behaviour and time data by algorithms if we have more time.
